							What Went Well

								I was unfamiliar with D3.js before starting to
								code Hyper Typer but was curious about how one
								might combine the fluidity of a React.js
								application with data visualization techniques.
								Now having experimented with it somewhat in
								order to achieve the interactive
								words-per-minute chart featured in the app,
								I&apos;m glad to have some experience using it
								to draw from in future projects.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a tangent to gaining experience with D3 I was
								also able to grow my understanding of SVGs and
								their native building block elements
								(&lt;path&gt;, &lt;circle&gt;, &lt;g&gt;, etc.)
								since D3 uses SVG to render data to the page.
								That knowledge has been monumentally helpful
								while building this portfolio page!
							</p>
							<p>
								I was also keen on the idea from the very start
								of using self-typing text as an aesthetic
								sprinkle for this project given its theme, and
								was delighted to find along the way the{' '}
								<a
									className='underline'
									href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-typewriter'
								>
									React Simple Typewriter
								</a>{' '}
								NPM package which makes this task very simple
								and straightforward!

							What Was Tricky
						</h2>
						<div className='space-y-8 px-8 md:max-w-[80%] md:pr-0'>
							<p>
								Hyper Typer was the first application with
								multi-page routing which I attempted to deploy
								live (using{' '}
								<a
									className='underline'
									href='https://netlify.com'
								>
									Netlify.com
								</a>
								). I quickly ran into issues with page redirects
								causing a 404 &quot;Page Not Found&quot; error,
								even at key app routes with specified content
								that seemingly would not need to redirect.
							</p>
							<div
								id='errorImgWrapper'
								className='relative mx-auto flex h-auto justify-center md:w-auto md:max-w-[60%]'
							>
								<Image
									alt='Error message from Netlify due to faulty redirects'
									src={netlifyError}
								/>
							</div>
							<p>
								Fortunately this error is well-documented and
								can be resolved by adding a <i>_redirects</i>{' '}
								file with some very brief instructions in the
								/public directory of your React app. But it was
								an intimidating problem the first time!
							</p>
							<p>
								Hyper Typer also saw issues early on with
								generating appropriate words from the word bank
								API endpoint that it was originally configured
								to request from. Since few configuration options
								were available, I scrapped the preconfigured API
								altogether and instead added a separate file
								containing a large array of (consistently
								inoffensive) words directly into the app
								contents.
							</p>
							<div
								id='errorImgWrapper'
								className='relative mx-auto flex h-auto max-h-80 justify-center md:w-auto'
							>
								<Image
									alt='Revised word list to be used for generating a random typing prompt'
									src={wordList}
									objectFit='cover'
									objectPosition='top'
								/>
							</div>
							<p>
								This approach amounts to a <i>slightly</i>{' '}
								larger project size but also offers more
								flexibility in the implementation (e.g.
								filtering for words of a certain length) and
								more freedom from third-party resources.

						Key Takeaways
					</h2>
					<div className='mt-16 flex flex-col space-y-8 px-8 md:pr-0'>
						<p>
							What I learned perhaps more than any framework or
							architectural pattern while making this app is that
							one great idea for a project may come unexpectedly
							as a result of experimenting in a different project.
						</p>
						<p>
							So the moral of the story is:{' '}
							<strong>keep coding and making projects!</strong>{' '}
							üë®‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è
						</p>
						<p>
							Hyper Typer, and in particular working with D3 for
							the interactive words-per-minute chart, has also
							strengthened my comfort level working with SVG
							imagery and has encouraged me to implement it more
							often in recent projects!
